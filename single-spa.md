# ðŸ”© single-spa

To integrate `tss-react` with [`single-spa`](https://single-spa.js.org/) please reproduce [this example](https://github.com/garronej/tss-react/issues/69#issuecomment-1112587437).

{% hint style="info" %}
The example was for tss-react v3. Before implementing this solution try the naive way first. I haven't tried yet but it should work out of the box with v4.
